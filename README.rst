The EcmaScript 5 implementation of
`the Miruken specification <https://github.com/miruken/Specification>`_

It runs is current browsers as is and has no need of transpilers.

Miruken is a framework that embraces true object-oriented JavaScript.

JavaScript historically does not leverage object-oriented principles.
This often results in unnecessary and undesirable coupling and complexity.
Miruken leverages inversion of control and the dynamic capabilities of
JavaScript to fill this missing layer and amplify the object-oriented
capabilites of JavaScript.

Miruken focuses on the challenges surrounding **models** and **controllers**.
It does all the heavy lifting for object inheritance, properties, mapping,
validation, and error handling. Other frameworks like AngularJS have 
the **view** covered.
